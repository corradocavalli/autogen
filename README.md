## Autogen from zero to hero

This repository is a summary of my study sessions on the AutoGen framework.

It consists of a series of notebooks documenting various experiments conducted while following the official documentation, as well as a small demo project to apply what Iâ€™ve learned in a practical way.

If you are also interested in AutoGen and looking for a hands-on example, feel free to explore the available resources.

I hope you find it helpful!
